  <h1>Apology cutie 💌</h1>
  <p>
   Hey jel, I wish I could give you flowers today, but I’ve made a promise to myself not to give flowers just yet. I hope you understand and if that's okay? I know things might be tough with your family right now, so whether we go on a date or not is entirely up to you. I just want you to feel cared for and supported, no matter what.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will always be here for you cutie :)
  </p>
  <p>and i made you these ↓</p>
