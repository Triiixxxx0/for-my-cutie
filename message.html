  <h1>For You ❤️</h1>
  <p>
    These past one and a half months of courting you have meant more to me than I can fully express. Every day, I find myself appreciating you more your kindness, your patience, the way you laugh, and the way you make even ordinary moments feel brighter and lighter.

Even when I’m busy, you’re always on my mind. I think about the little things that make you who you are, and it makes me feel grateful to know you. I know life isn’t always easy, and I respect the effort and dedication you put into your school work and your future career. I want you to know that I’m here for you, without pressure, and I care about you sincerely.
    This is just the beginning of getting to know each other, and I feel lucky for every conversation, every smile, and every memory we’ve shared so far. I hope we can continue to make more moments together, laugh together, and support each other along the way. Thank you for being you someone who makes life feel warmer, brighter, and a little more special every day.
